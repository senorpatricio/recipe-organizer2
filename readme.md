## Recipe Organizer 2

This is my second attempt at getting a recipe organizer app working. This is a project we made while attending Coding Campus in Provo, UT, a coding bootcamp where we focused on the [AngularJS] and [Django] frameworks in building responsive web applications. It is a RESTful application, applying Restangular on the front, and Django Rest Framework on the back. 

This app demonstrates CRUD functionality, allowing you to Create, Read, Update, and Destroy.
